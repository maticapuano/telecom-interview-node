## Introduction

Is a simple weather forecast application that provides the current weather forecast and the next 5 days forecast for the current city.

The application has been developed using Node.js and the following libraries:

-   [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-   [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
-   [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Features

## Architecture

The Modules Arquitecture pattern is a variation of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. In the Modules Arquitecture pattern, the Controller and the View components are further divided into smaller subcomponents. This results in a more modular and extensible design.
